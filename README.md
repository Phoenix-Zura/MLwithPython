1. leannPandas.py and the following excel sheet containing the data of recent recrutes is shown in this code with all the possible manuplations and most frequently used functions of pandas in data science
2. different types of data are generally, numerical data(all numbers data), categorical data(yes or no/binaray data/etc.) and ordinal data(mixture of number and categorical data like movie ratings).
3. statistics in data science, mean (average), median(the middle value or class/category of the sorted data), median is less susceptable to outliers than mean. mean can be skewed by few no. of higher values. mode(most common value of the data and not relevant to continous numerical data).
4. meanmedianmode.py uses the numpy package to calculate the mean and median of the data package.S
5. variation and standard deviation, they give the measure of the dispersion of the data in the dataset. Variance is avg of squared difference from the mean and the data in dataset. standard deviation is squareroot of variance. it is used to show the outliers. The data points which lie more than 1 standard deviation from the mean are considered unusual.
6. Population vs sample data - if we are working with sample data instead of the entire dataset then we use the "sample variance" instead of entire population variance.
7. stdandvariance.py file used numpy and matplotlib package to estimate the entire standard deviation and variance of the data in a dataset.
8. probability density function(used incase of continous data) gives the probability of a datapoint falling within some given range of a given value.
9. probability mass fuctions(used incase of discrete data) does the same job.
